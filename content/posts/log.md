# Daily Log
***12.13.2017***

## Meeting w/ SD & SR.
* Design discussions in general
* Some annoying feelings about being saddled w/ other design works and then dealing w/ the fallout
  * _note to self:_ one should be more gracious about this fact
* More design work on Shared Collections
  * Title links links on search results
    * text underlines are perceived to be preventing effective scanning
    * this runs counter to a11y recommendations
  * filters and how to better approach
    * stronger connection to search and filtering: see air b&b
    * explore accordions, better modal or interrupt
  * better listing of results themselves
    * the availability table need some

## Work on global header search
* two design patterns worked up
  * created formal buttons instead of radio controls
  * added third (braille & talking library) choice to line up
  * rearranged icons
  * need third option

## Shelf Checkout
* added iOS icons to repo. Greg O. merged.
