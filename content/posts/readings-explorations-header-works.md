## Reading
* helpful CSS Grid articles read:
  - [Breaking out with CSS Grid explained](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/06/01/breaking-out-with-css-grid-explained/)
  - [Design Systems and CSS Grid](https://24ways.org/2017/design-systems-and-css-grid/)
    + Useful takeaways:
      * how to achieve multicolumn layout w/ outer columns (wrapping the inner columns) without a wrapping ````div````
      * using named grid lines to achieve a complex layout [Layout using named grid lines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Layout_using_Named_Grid_Lines)
      * usage of css named variables as opposed to sass

## Update & Exploration to TK example for discovery search results screen
* made the results listing tables look more table like
* increased line height, ````<h3>```` text size and tightened up the composition
* as per SD created prototype so the filter accordion can be visualized


## New Header / Global Search designs
* futzing w/ Sketch symbols and getting to work is a pain.
  - need to read up on how to do it right and get them to scale and transform
* got wires crossed on login (braille talking library) & proper search buttons.
  - the braille library link goes in the login drop down: derp
