## More work on the header
* specifically login, presently there is some pretty gross misalignment, so having SD point it out, its kinda nice that I might be able to jump in and fix

## Works w/ the dgx-svg-icon repo
* updated that repo w/ some new icons and cleaning up many others there.
* still need to go through and update them all
* should set up an Automator task to run `svgo` when the files get added or updated...

## Reading
* last hour (or next week!) of work should be spent reading these articles on front end design and development. Now I can close all those pesky tabs and windows w/ things I need to read over.

    + [The State of UX in 2018](https://trends.uxdesign.cc/)

        - trends towards redefining what this particular branch of design means
          + Designers focusing on new paths and specializations
          + Designers should understand "business" better
        - Part 2: Design for Immediacy
          + Demand for speedier responses... for everything.
          + _"In 2018, we have to step back and look at the full ecosystem that brands and users share, to define how the business can still be relevant in a world ruled and disrupted by immediacy."_
            * as a designer how to incorporate this mentality into current products?
            * at NYPL how quickly we deliver the "product"?
