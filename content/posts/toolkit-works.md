## Progress

* added the project index to the TK. Seems like it should be there instead of a standalone project
* futzed w/ some styles

## New Header / Global Search designs
* liking the way this is shaping up despite having not 2 but 3 buttons to run a search against
* still undecided about the button style
  - to round the corners?
  - square them
  - or pill style them... its tough.
* a unifying principal should come into play here
  - develop a conceptual reasoning
  - pills feel more friendly
  - rounded corners want to be taken seriously, but also want to be inviting
  - squared of corners are all business
