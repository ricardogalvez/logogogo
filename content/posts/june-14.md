## June 14 â€” 27

### Worked on the header app focus styles

* getting through that can be a challenge
  - search,
  - some styles are set in JS. Need to discuss w/ EG about that,
    - probably done to be non-render blocking
  - Updated focus styles for header's drop downs
  

### Took a look at the new work from Allan

* not sure if my feedback is welcome in email format, so I'll just sit on it until friday's meet
* That said, here it is:
  - I'm a sucker for the dutone
  - warm tones are succeeding in conveying reliability, earthy, solid
  - possible to see a dashboard w/ more info graphicy components?

### Sprint plannings:

* a touch annoying as usual, but non-eventful really...

### CUNY UX Review
Sat in on a review SD organized w/ some UX students from CUNY,

* tasked w/ impoving the UX of the Get a Library Card experience
  - some validation as one of the projects came to many of the same conclusions as we did when working on that project

## SCC Works

* work w/ willa, paul and daniel on the new tab interface
  - some frustrations on policy

## June 18 - 27
* Greg was able to get updates in as well, so far so good.
  - some difficulty w/ blocks content wrapped in `<a>` tags... might need to abandon the box-shadow property.
