## Picking back up this contemporaneous habit

Update:
Thi particular post will reflect all the weeks works...
After some discussions about process and how work is tracked, I think it a good idea to get back with daily log of activities.

* work on dgx header
  - via this ticket: [PS-625](https://jira.nypl.org/browse/PS-625) & [PS-626](https://jira.nypl.org/browse/PS-625)
  - created a new icon for the NYPL Shop
  - updated the dgx-svg-icons repo to have the new icon, and did a bit of clean up there
  - to set up to work with our AWS ecosystem, so now I'm pushing up to a NYPL Sandbox
* work on the SimplyE Audio player
  - pushed the static design work to invision
  - cleaned up some of the patterns therein
  - updated the way the transport / scrubber bar thing is looking
    * moved the remaining time of the book to the top, and chapter elapsed/remaining times below the transport bar
    * widened the transport bar to maximize the entire viewport
* Helped KTP with the refile page on the ReCap admin
