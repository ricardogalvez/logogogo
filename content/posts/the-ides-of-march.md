## Picking back up this contemporaneous habit

After some discussions about process and how work is tracked, I think it a good idea to get back with daily log of activities.

* work on dgx header
* work on the SimplyE Audio player
  - pushed the static design work to invision
  - cleaned up some of the patterns therein
* starting work on [PS-625](https://jira.nypl.org/browse/PS-625)
