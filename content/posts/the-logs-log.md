## the day's work is almost done

* much work on the Sketch file for discovery filters
    * need to figure out how to effectively share out this work
    * might be hard for non-designers to work with it.

* SR foisted a bunch of accessibility work on me this morning, seems like its a bit out of my scope of responsibilities to be working on VPATs
