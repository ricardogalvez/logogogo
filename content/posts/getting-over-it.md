### One must learn to be open.

So I'm going to be open. This is a beginning not an end. And at the end of it all, there is much to learn and gain.

### Today:

  * More progress on the Filtering Project Overview & Schematic
  * TODO:
    - Complete the actual sketch components and screens
    - The overall purpose of getting the Sketch elements complete is to build out the set of importable Sketch Libraries so comps can be easily created.
