title: "Streamline Visual Design & UX to Production"

## _Invite notice for a meeting:_

Kick off discussion on improving and streamlining our UX / Visual Design Concept & Front end development work flow.
For consideration and discussion:

* Wire framing / Very Low Fidelity product and concept development
    - a11y & semantics
    - use case scenarios
    - persona considerations
* Sketch Comps and Internal Product Documentation
* Static screen development with Avocode
* Toolkit Integration
* Development to Production

## Sketch towards a set of master docs
* Sketch Libraries should be analogs of their code counterparts
    - Ideally there should be no daylight between the two
    - Challenge: making the above a reality
* Channeling Sketch layouts to Avocode for static coding
    - Still unsure if this is a good idea
    - Question: should we just be designing / prototyping in code?
