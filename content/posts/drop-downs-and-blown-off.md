* `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
* Continuing work on search drop & login downs
* updated the alert & library card icons
* working on the master icon sketch file.
  - Challenge here is keeping the static files in parity w/ one another.
    + Sketch / Illustrator / raw svgs / dgx-svg-icons
  - Is it necessary? just compose in illustrator and then when needed in sketch drag and drop from the finder?
