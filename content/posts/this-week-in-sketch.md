## Sketch...
Sketch is cool for the most part. What I'm grateful for and a few criticisms:

  * Libraries. pretty exciting. I like being able to link to a master icon library or different sets of components. This is working well and I like how this can be an analog to set of static html components that could then be easily translated into React components or any other framework for that matter.
  * The way you're notified by Sketch when an external library has been updated is bit crazy, a tiny notification in the top of the screen. There has to be a better way...


## A rationale for wireframing in a wireframing tool and not Sketch

Previously when there was only one designer working on many project, it was natural to want to create a more collaborative working space where all concerned parties could work on the initial stages of a product. We could discuss interactions, semantics and DOM structure and agree upon a course of action before getting too deep into design or implementation. It gives product owners a chance to develop and publicize a solid conceptual foundation for their project/product. It allows for accessibility issues to be raised and resolved before developers and designer get deep into their work. Assumptions about operability and interactions can be tested with minimal risk.

Wire frames are extremely useful insofar as it gives the team a clear sense of the purpose of the product without the expectations attached to higher fidelity designs.

## Why I'm not extra crazy about so called prototyping tools
Invision is too limited in its capability to produce a realistic experience. Invision is good for simple page click throughs but quickly breaks down when more complex interactions are needed, and we need them all the time. The possibility for creating false expectations is high. If we can provide a basically functional `html` prototype, I think that is just as valuable if not more than a service based prototype. We can serve it locally without needing or paying a third party. Another pro, is to be working in the medium's final product. Invision prototypes are never a final destination.

## And a few other things...

I'm reading [_Articulating Design Decisions_ by Tom Greever](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920037422.do) and its really insightful. Much of what is discussed I had an inkling of... but it is good to read about it, and be able to reflect upon one's own behavior and see how one might see opportunities for growth.
