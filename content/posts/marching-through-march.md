## Notes from a Monday and a Tuesday
* meeting w/ Leonard about proposed changes to SimplyE Catalog view
  * Discussion about Search Field and its location and how it manifests in various contexts
  * Various Lane reorganizations
  * Best Sellers & Staff Picks needs rethinking to be a unified single
  * Split apart YA & Children's
    * Children's should be scoped so searches will only be executed on Children's Content
  * Fiction Supersection:
    * A small set of sub-genres should be identified
    * A lane for all books organized alphabetically by author
  * New Arrivals super set
    * recently arrived and available for checkout
    * Sub-lanes should have a "new in..." lane
