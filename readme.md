## logogogo

Is a personal blog built with Hugo. It uses gulp and a few of sass related libraries to help manage the styles.

The overall goal is to keep a semi-daily log of the work I do at nypl. I want it to be a place where I can keep a narrative record of projects, tech and design work.

Additionally, I'm a designer, who wants to be much better at writing solid front end code, so I'm trying to develop good habits both in how I document my work and the work itself.

I'm not exactly sure where the name logogogo came from, but it popped into my head when I initialized the Hugo project and it stuck.

## Change Log:
